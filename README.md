# MC-DPF (Minecraft Debug Player Finder)
This is a small command-line utility for extracting coordinates from a multiplayer server's crash logs

### How it works
I have found that when Minecraft Crashes and I was on a server, everyone on the server's coordinates get logged to the debug.log file, so I built a simple parser and viewer tool.


### Keyboard shortcuts
**Control+H** - Help<br>
**Control+B** - Restart and re-render screen<br>
**Control+Q** - Quit<br>
**Esc**               - Close menu (Only available in menus)<br>


### Change Log v1.1.0
- Added an Export button to parser for saving result as file
- Added a Raw button to parser for displaying result as raw text
